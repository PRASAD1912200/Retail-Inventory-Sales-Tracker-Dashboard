# Retail Inventory & Sales Tracker Dashboard

## Overview
A responsive dashboard for visualizing retail inventory and sales data, built with ReactJS and Chart.js.

## Architecture
- **React Functional Components & Hooks:** The UI is built using functional components (`App`, `Dashboard`, `ChartSection`, `Filters`) and React hooks for state and effect management.
- **Chart.js Integration:** Charts are rendered using Chart.js via CDN for bar, line, and pie visualizations.
- **Mocked REST API:** Data is fetched asynchronously (simulated with a timeout) to mimic real API calls.
- **Filters & Dropdowns:** Users can filter data by product category and region using dropdowns.
- **Responsive CSS3:** The layout adapts for mobile and desktop using modern CSS Grid and Flexbox.
